# 07. Create a Proof of Concept Exploit of a CSRF Vulnerable Website

**CSRF** Cross site request forgery

An attacker tricks the user into visiting the attackers website, which is pretending to be the target site which then submits a malicious request on behalf of the user to the target website.

In the terminal `sudo npm run start evil.com` this will start a server at evil.com:666/index.html (This is the attracker website)

Logged into the target site we want to submit the word hacked instead of hello if you inspect the source of the page you will see the message is in a form

Copy the form and copy it into the index.html of the attackers website and change the url in `<form action=` to `https://localhost.charlesproxy.com` and change the `<textarea name”message”` to HACKED

Give the from it `id` of `theform` then add a `<script`> tag inside the tag type `theform.submit()`

This will make the malicious form submit itself 

So the real user won’t noticed they been hacked we submit the form to hidden iframe on the page then add a `target` to the form set it to `hiddenFrame`

And wrap it in a `<div> with a `hidden` attribute

```html
<div hidden>
<iframe name=”hiddenFrame”></iframe>
<form id=”theform”
	action=”https://localhost.charlesproxy.com/”
	target=”hiddenFrame” method=”post”
…
</div>
```

Now it should be submitting to a hidden iframe via hidden form.
